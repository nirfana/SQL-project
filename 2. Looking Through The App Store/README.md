# Looking through The Apps Store Data

This analysis explores the factors contributing to the success of mobile apps, focusing on key elements such as app type, user preferences, and effective promotional strategies. With millions of apps available on the App Store, developers seek insights into creating profitable applications.

## Data Source and Limitations

I obtained the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a platform offering a diverse range of datasets for exploration. Specifically, I utilized the Mobile App Store dataset, containing information on over 7200 apps. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps). Ramanathan Perumal extracted the data from the iTunes Search API on the Apple Inc. website in July 2017.

However, it is important to note certain limitations associated with the 2017 Mobile App Store dataset:

- The data might not accurately represent the current mobile app market, which has undergone substantial growth and evolution since 2017. New app categories have emerged, and the popularity of existing categories has likely shifted.
- Information about new app store features introduced after 2017, such as app subscriptions, in-app purchases, and augmented reality experiences, may be absent from the dataset.
- The data may not align with current app development trends, as significant changes have occurred in the app development landscape since 2017.
